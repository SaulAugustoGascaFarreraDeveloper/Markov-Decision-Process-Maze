# Markov-Decision-Process-Maze
This project implements a classic reinforcement learning task to explore the Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a deterministic policy, where the agent must find the goal state to successfully complete an episode.

This project use Gymnasium (an open-source Python library and the current standard toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms).

First we need run the envs/maze.py project because contains the maze creation setup with pygame and gymnasium to after run the Markov Decision Process.ipynb to see to epxlore the results

##Example of maze.py code:
